3d cloud rendering notes:



Currently rendering density isosurfaces: 


To Use, Run importdata and then plotter3(cloud) in MATLAB


ninterp=17 works well because it generates a vertical resolution of 17*8~horiz res.


we apply median filters. One before the interpolation, and optionally one after.


the first median filter speeds up the interpolation significantly and cleans the final result


the 3D median filter added after the interpolation is VERY slow: turns a 3s runtime to 60s with a 5x5 window


smooth3 is better with 13s runtime 

imported a mesh smoothing tool from http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/26710-smooth-triangulated-mesh


works reasonably well, but it’s still a little noisy


4ms: hard to show soliton: overwhelmed by the sound waves for now


140ms: clear vortex. 
Slices were not averaged. 
Central slice is weaker - atom number fluctuations
